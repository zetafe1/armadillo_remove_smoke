# Remove Armadillo Cholera Cloud/Smoke from the sky

"Armadillo Cholera Cloud/Smoke in sky" unfortunatelly is not yet removable by streaming for RedM server side, only client side!
So, for that you need to add the file popzone.ymt on your RedM.

Instruction:
This will make your sky in Armadillo clean without the Cholera smoke Cloud & you can give it to your server players.

Open your RedM folder, go to RedM Application Data, Citizen, Platform and inside create folder "levels", inside levels create folder "rdr3"
and place the file popzone.ymt there.

 ...RedM\RedM\RedM.app\citizen\platform\levels\rdr3

again, atm this is only client! It will only work on your RedM app not in the server!
