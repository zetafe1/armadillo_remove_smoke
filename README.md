# Remove Armadillo Cholera Cloud/Smoke from the sky

"Armadillo Cholera Cloud/Smoke in sky" unfortunatelly is not yet removable by streaming for RedM server side, it is only RedM client side!
So, for that you need to add the file popzone.ymt on your RedM files.

Instruction:
This will make your sky in Armadillo clean without the Cholera smoke Cloud & you can give it to your server players.

Open your RedM folder, go to RedM Application Data, Citizen, Platform and inside create folder "levels", inside levels create folder "rdr3"
and place the file popzone.ymt there.

 ...RedM\RedM\RedM.app\citizen\platform\levels\rdr3

again, atm this is only RedM client! It will only work for you, on your RedM app, not to all players in the server! 
You can share this with your players so everybody can have a clean sky!
